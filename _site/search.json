By opening the attribute table and viewing all the locations, we saw that bridleways were not in our areas of consideration, so we removed all occurrences of bridleway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewing of all data in Excel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe realised that there was too much data to manipulate in GQIS. As such, we exported the attribute table to Excel.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis allowed us to create a pivot table to visualise the more dominant features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from the Pivot table made, that a large proportion of all the roads we analysed belong to the service, footway, and residential categories. We will conduct a deeper investigation on what these classes of roads mean in the Singaporean context, and how it will be relevant to our analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe compared this data to the Data Dictionary provided with the file. This allowed us to determine what the different features represented.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to determine which parts roads pedestrians can walk on we first visited the Singapore Legal Statutes:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found that “jaywalking” was only an offence if done within 50m of a designated crossing area or over a dividing railing. As such, we needed to analyse the road classifications to find which roads would be suitable to cross informally (expected to include tracks and residential roads).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEncoding Road Data\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then created an excel sheet to classify the road types manually. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe opened each layer next to Google Maps street view to see what representations of each class looked like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCycleway\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could see that cycleways are wide open spaces, well suited for both bicycles and pedestrians. We coded them accordingly. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe speed limit we chose was 25km/h as that is the maximum speed limit for shared paths in Singapore under the 2018 Active Mobility Regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe code the data accordingly:\n\n\n\n\n\nFootway\n\n\n\n\n\nFor footways, we can see that they encompass normal pavements. Although they are narrower, we can say that they are suitable for bicycles. Based on the previously mentioned legislation, the maximum speed for footways is 10km/h as such, we will code the data accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne important factor to note is that not all pavements have been encoded into the analysis. \n\n\nThe road on the left only appears as a ‘service’ road, even though it also has a pavement. As such, we can expect to code service roads as walkable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving street\n\n\nAccording to the data dictionary, living streets are streets “where pedestrians have priority”. There weren’t many of these streets near the area of analysis, but the areas that did have living streets tended to be located near a lot of commercial activity, attracting many visitors. One such example, about 1.5km from Tanjong Rhu station is Muskat Street, outside Sultan Mosque. \n\n\n\n\n\nSince this area is dedicated as having “Pedestrian priority,” we treat it as a footpath and limit the bicycle speed to 10 km/h.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotorway\n\n\nThe main motorway running through our area of analysis is the East Coast Parkway Expressway (ECP).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ECP and all motorways are not suitable for bicycles as stated in the legal statutes. However, the expressway does have frequent underground crossings (pictured to right of street view). In this case, the crossing are coded as ‘footways’. \n\n\n\n\n\nTo prevent bicycles from going on the expressway, we set the bikespeed to 0 km/h.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotorway link\n\n\nSince motorway links lead to motorways, they will be classified in the same way.\n\n\n\n\n\nPath\n\n\nIt was not immediately obvious what the difference between a path and a footpath was, however after analysing the area outside Singlap station, it was clear that an example of a path in the local context is a dirt path, without any proper concrete paving. \n\n\n\n\n\nDue to their narrow width, we can classify paths similarly to how we did footpaths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPedestrian\n\n\nRoads coded as ‘pedestrian’ are frequently located right outside the coming Marine Parade MRT Station. They tend to be pedestrianised roads and are crowded with local shops.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the google maps street view, we see that while there is heavy bicycle usage, the pathways can be quite narrow. As such, they are classified similarly to footpaths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary\n\n\nThe most prominent primary road is Marine Parade Road. It is a bustling street with moderate vehicle traffic. \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that large portions of the road are more than 50 metres from a crossing location. As such, jaywalking is permitted and the road can be classified as crossable. We also see that there are footpaths located parallel to the road, so we will not classify the road as walkable. Since the traffic is slow-moving, we classify “heavy vehicles” as false. Since bicycles are permitted on the road, we say that the bike speed is 30 km/h.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary link\n\n\nOne example of a Primary link class road is a road connector (or a fork) that connects Mountbatten Road to the Tanjong Katong Road South. This road class consists of roads that link the Primary class roads to other Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary class roads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the GoogleMap view, we can see that this road class is the same in nature as the Primary road class, we will hence encode this class the same way Primary roads are encoded. To support this decision, we can also see that Primary link roads usually have a zebra road crossing, making it crossable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidential\n\n\nResidential Roads consist of roads that connect residential areas, like affordable public housing (HDBs) and landed properties, much like the Kee Sun Avenue residential area seen in the screenshot below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese roads usually invite less traffic because they connect residential areas, where busy activities like commercial or entertainment do not usually happen. Most traffic would justly be transport activities to and from people’s living spaces, which probably will not happen more than a few times a day. \n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being regular asphalt roads, we will hereby classify them as walkable and crossable. Since these roads are generally less busy and have fewer heavy vehicles, cyclers will also have a speed of 30km/h.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary\n\n\nSecondary roads are generally smaller roads that connect to smaller towns. In the case of the screenshot below, Tanjong Katong Road South had branched off from the Primary road of Mountbatten road. This allows commuters to access deeper, less busy areas like residential areas, or transfer from one Primary road to another major road, like another Primary road or a Motorway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see from the screenshot above, large portions of the road are more than 50 metres from a crossing location, much like Primary roads. As such, jaywalking is permitted and Secondary roads will hereby be classified as crossable. Since this is a generally busy road, we will also not classify the road as walkable. Similarly, since the traffic can be fast moving, we classify “heavy vehicles” as true. Since bicycles are permitted on the road, we say that the bike speed is 30 km/h.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary link\n\n\nSimilar to Primary link roads, Secondary link roads connect Secondary roads to other classes of roads, like Primary Roads, other Secondary roads, or in the case of the screenshot below, where East Coast Road branches into Telok Kurau Road, it connects to a Tertiary Road. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Secondary link roads are extensions to Secondary roads and are similar to Primary link roads whereby they usually consist of a zebra crossing for pedestrians. As such, we will classify them as non-walkable, crossable, with heavy vehicular traffic, and with a bike speed of 30km/h. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService\n\n\nService Roads consist of smaller and shorter roads that connect larger roads like Primary Roads, Secondary Roads, and Tertiary Roads to public infrastructure like petrol stations, and parking spaces, or are roads that are within a certain compound, like a school, or in the case of the screenshot below, a residential compound, Marine Terrace Breeze, south of the Marine Terrace Station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince these roads do not have heavy vehicular traffic and are usually quiet, we will classify these roads as walkable and crossable. We will also set the maximum bicycle speed as 15 km/h in line with the road speed limit for all vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps\n\n\nSteps Roads consist of a flight of steps that pedestrians have access to via walkways or footways. One common occurrence of steps is the flight of steps leading up to overhead bridges, as shown in the screenshot below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince these “roads” are non-vehicular and are for people, we hence will classify them as walkable, crossable, without heavy vehicular traffic. Since cyclist will be able to carry their bikes over the steps, they will travel at the 4 km/h walking speed. As such, bike speed is set to 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTertiary\n\n\nTertiary Roads are similar to Secondary Roads, whereby it is a lower class of roads that connect to even smaller roads like Service Roads. It also acts as a connector between higher classes of roads like Primary Roads and, in the case as seen in the screenshot below, Bayshore Road, which connects to a Secondary Road, Upper East Coast Road to the Motorway link towards East Coast Parkway. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince these roads are generally busy with heavy vehicular traffic, especially in the case of Bayshore Road, we will not classify them as walkable. However, similarly to Primary and Secondary Roads, we will still classify them as crossable, and set the maximum biking speed to 30km/h.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTertiary link\n\n\nTertiary link roads are roads that branch off Tertiary roads, similar to Primary and Secondary link roads. They consist of regular asphalt roads that connect Tertiary roads to lower classes or smaller roads like Residential roads and Service roads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince these roads are the same in nature as Tertiary roads, we will encode them the same way - as non-walkable, crossable, with heavy vehicular traffic, and with a maximum biking speed of 30km/h.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack (Track grade1, 2, 3, 4 and 5)\n\n\nTrack Roads (including grades one through five) are generally paved or unpaved roads that are used in natural environments like nature reserves and parks. However, most of the Track roads in and even outside our work area (along the TEL Stage 4 stations) are usually behind a gate, indicating that these roads are off-limits by the common citizen. The screenshots below show examples of these roads. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHence, we will categorise these roads as unwalkable, uncrossable, without any heavy vehicular traffic and a max biking speed of 0 km/h.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrunk\n\n\nTrunk Roads are similar to Motorway Roads, in which they carry very heavy and high-speed traffic over long distances. In the screenshot below, Still Road South, a Trunk Road, is a semi-expressway entrance ramp to the Outer Ring Road System. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince trunk roads are generally expressways that travel a long distance and have very heavy and high-speed traffic, it would would be extremely difficult and unsafe for pedestrian and cyclists to travel using them. Additionally, people (without heavy vehicles) and cyclists are, by law, barred from expressways. We will thus classify them as unwalkable, uncrossable, with heavy vehicular traffic and 0 km/h for cyclists. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe screenshot below shows the Singapore Legal Statutes prohibiting and persons on enter or staying on an expressway on foot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe screenshot below shows the Land Transport Authority issuing a warning about the prohibition of cyclists on expressways:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrunk Link\n\n\nSimilar to Trunk Roads, Trunk Link roads are linking roads that link Trunk Roads to other Trunk Roads, or roads with a lower class like Primary, Secondary, or Tertiary Roads. In the screenshot below, we can see the Trunk Link Road connecting Still Road South to the East Coast Park Service Road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, pedestrians and cyclists are not allowed on Trunk Roads. Since Trunk Link Roads are meant for linking Trunk Roads to other roads, we will classify this road as unwalkable, uncrossable, with heavy vehicular traffic and 0 km/h for cyclists. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnclassified\n\n\nUnclassified roads are roads that are general-use roads that do not usually carry heavy traffic. The screenshot below shows an example of an Unclassified Road, the East Coast Park Service Road, that allows vehicles to travel along the the East Coast Park area. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince these roads are generally less busy, we will classify them as walkable, crossable, without heavy vehicular traffic, and with a cycling speed of 30km/h.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnknown\n\n\nUnknown Roads are road types that are unknown, unlabelled, or unclassified. There is only one road in Singapore that is classified as such, but it is beyond our work area. For informational purposes, the screenshot below shows a concrete pavement branching off of Kim Keat Avenue, near the Bradell-Toa Payoh area, to a concrete futsal court. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor completion’s sake, we will classify Unknown Roads as unwalkable, uncrossable, without heavy vehicular traffic and a maximum biking speed of 0km/h. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlank\n\n\nRoad data that is classified as Blank do not have any data on the type of road. In our dataset, there are 0 Blank data. For completion’s sake, we will classify Blank Roads as unwalkable, uncrossable, without heavy vehicular traffic and a maximum biking speed of 0km/h. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQGIS Integration (for Road Data)\n\n\nConverting Encoded data to SQL\n\n\nThe coded data needed to be converted to SQL.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy using excel string concatenation, we programmatically created the SQL code and filled it across all cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then ran the resulting code in the field calculator function of QGIS. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe carefully look through the preview section to ensure that the correct code has been assigned. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy carefully inspecting the resulting table, we can see that the data is encoded as desired.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe repeat the steps for the remaining three columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExporting the layers in QGIS\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to access just the walkable paths, we select walkable features and add them to a layer named ‘walkable’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs such, we can create layers for each of the respective analysis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQNEAT 3 analysis\n\n\nWhen filling out the QNEAT form, we realised that there was no function to indicate that roads are crossable and not, as such we did analysis on the map to find out the average distance between crossable and non-crossable roads. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe found that crossable roads tended to be less than 15 metres apart.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile non-crossable roads (such as expressways) were over 20 metres apart.\n\n\nAs such, we set the topological tolerance for our study at 15 meres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we can set up the batch process with the above parameters with topological tolerance of 0 metres.\n\n\nAnd do another analysis with topological tolerance of 15 metres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the result of both analysis has been computed, we can see that there is a slight problem with the rendering — there are some lines where there shouldn’t be — especially for the smaller analysis areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo do this, we tried increasing the raster cell size from 10 to 100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoing so resulted in the error margin being reduced. However there were still some erroneous data points. As shown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen changing the cell size to 5, we get the following result:\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter carefully exporting and considering over 20 layers of ise-areas, we decided that using an iso-area with a tolerance of 15 and cell size of 120 would be ideal for our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy changing the symbology, we can better see the variation for each of the transportation modes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating the demand for TEL4 stations\n\n\nHousehold demand\n\n\nAfter creating the 1km dissolved buffer zone from the TEL4 stations, we searched for the number of households living in each condominium or apartment complex. However, there is insufficient information on the internet. Thus, we assume that the number of households is equivalent to the number of units in the apartment complex within the buffer zone.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor HDB apartment complexes, data on the total number of units per HDB block belonging to an estate can be found. However, for condominiums, only data on total number of units for the whole condominium can be found. We then decided to standardise by calculating the number of units for the whole estate for HDBs, and the number of units for the whole condominium. The same thing applies to landed properties.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we start, let’s clip the dissolved buffer zone layer with the land use layer as such.\n\n\n\n\n\nHDB apartments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the picture above, Marine Terrace Haven estate comprises Blocks 51 to 59. We then individually searched for the number of HDB units in the first block, eg. Block 51 has 270 units as shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe left column refers to the block number while the right column refers to the total number of units. Using basic Excel functions, there are a total of 1595 units in Marine Terrace Haven estate.\n\n\nCondominiums\n\n\nAs for the number of units in a condominium, the data is readily available. A simple Google search will tell you how many units without having to do extra calculations. For example, let’s search on the number of units in Costa Rhu Condominium. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above picture, we can see that there are 737 units in Costa Rhu condominium. We manually key in this data under the newly created field ‘Households’.\n\n\nLanded properties\n\n\nBefore we start, similar to what we did with the land use layer, clip the buildings layer together with the dissolved buffer zone.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince it is tougher to identify the number of units in the region, we will use the ‘select feature by freehand’.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Land Use layer is below the Buildings layer on the browser panel, use the tool above and drag along the boundary of the land use layer as shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may now open the attribute table to look at how many buildings you have selected.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the landed properties are semi-detached houses. Take this value and multiply it by 2 to account for them. We will repeat this process until we have covered all the landed properties found in our  land use layer.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter manually entering the households for all the residential buildings in the land use layer, click on the ‘Select by Expression’ icon and key in the following code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPush your selected features to the top by clicking on the following icon below. Your attribute table should look like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting the limitations\n\n\nHowever, you will notice that some of the HDBs, condominiums, landed properties and shophouses are still not accounted for in the OSM Landuse layer as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, in order to account for the other residential buildings, we will have to merge the buildings layer with the land use layer. \n\n\n\n\n\nAfter merging the vector layers, look at the regions without the land use layer and compare it with the Google Maps. An example is shown in the picture below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, compare the same area with Google Maps. You will notice that some of the buildings are HDB flats. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs such, similar to how you find the number of units per HDB block in the OSM Land Use layer earlier, repeat the same steps with Upper East Coast Road, as shown in the above picture.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the same steps until you have covered all the empty spots that the Land Use layer did not cover.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce done, open the Attribute Table of the Merged OSM layer. Click on the ‘Select by Expression’ icon, and key in the following SQL expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen click on the  icon.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn your Attribute Table dialog window, the heading should look like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom your Layers panel, right click on the merged OSM layers > Export > Save Selected Features As\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen save your household demand data into your SG Geopackage, named ‘residential_data’. This will remove all the null data in your merged OSM layer. \n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Total Household Demand\n\n\nOn your main QGIS window, click on Database > DB Manager\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce your DB Manager dialog window opens, on the left panel, click on Virtual Layers > Project Layers > residential_data layer to make the layer active.\n\n\nThen click on the icon above.\n\n\n\n\n\nType the following SQL expression.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen click on the Execute button below the SQL text box.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe query should return the sum of Household units.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value above is our estimation for the total number of households that are able to access the TEL Stage 4 MRT stations within the 1km buffer. Since the opening of TEL Stage 3, the government proposed that 180,000 households will be able to access the existing TEL stations from Woodlands North to Gardens by the Bay station. When TEL Stage 4 finally opens in 2024, we will have at least 234,000 households with access to the TEL stations from Woodlands North to Bayshore station. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoint-of-Interest (POI) demand\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints of Interest consist of any amenities, places, services or centres that people travel to.  This might include ATMs, schools, parks, swimming pools, shopping malls or cemeteries. In order to obtain the demand data for these points of interest in our catchment areas, we first clip the POIs that are in our catchment area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to prevent duplication of demand data, we will remove any polygon that are inside another larger polygon - in which the larger polygon will subsume the smaller polygons it contains. For example, we can see that in the screenshot below, there is a smaller polygon contained in the East Coast Park Zone B polygon. We will assume that people travelling to East Coast Park Zone B will be the same people who will visit the inner polygon, which is the Road Safety Community Park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the screenshot below, we selected the inner polygon and deleted it using the Select Features by Area or Single Click function to delete the polygon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter removing all the irrelevant polygons, we will begin classifying the POIs based on their approximate annual visitorship/demand using a csv file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our work area, two of the most prominent points of interest are East Coast Park, which attracts more than 7 million visitors per year (which we will hereby assume a conservative 7 million people), and National Stadium, which attracts more than 4.8 million visitors per year as of 2021. Since these two points are hotspots for visitors, we will separate them as another classification by modifying the fclass column in the attribute table.\n\n\n\n\n\nEast Coast Park\n\n\nEast Coast Park is not just a hub of various recreational activities, including cycling, skating, waterskiing, and fishing, but is also where a 15-kilometre-long beach sits. This makes East Coast Parks one of the most popular attractions among tourists and locals alike, with an estimated 7 million visitors per year as mentioned on the NParks website in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we will merge the polygons of all East Coast Park Zones into one East Coast Park polygon using the Edit Geometry function and merging the selected features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will thus record its annual visitorship of 7 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Stadium\n\n\nThe National Stadium is one of the prime spots in Singapore hosting large scale events like National Day Parade 2015 and countless concerts and sporting events. In the screenshot of a Straits Times below, we can observe that the National Stadium, also known as the Sports Hub, has attracted 4.8 million visitors in the year of 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will thus record its annual visitorship of 4.8 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool\n\n\nSchools are categorized as educational institutions or schools that are below the level of Junior Colleges. This includes Kindergartens, Primary and Secondary Schools. The screenshot below shows an example of a secondary school, St Patrick’s School, in the Marrine Terrace area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince each category (primary, secondary and kindergarten) has a large variance of number of students, we will separate them into 3 subcategories of the same name. We will also modify the fclass of these rows by researching their name to their level. Other schools that do not fit into the 3 subcategories will be classified as other schools.\n\n\nPrimary Schools\n\n\nUsing the data from data.gov.sg, we find that there are a total of 165,547 students and 11,799 teachers from government-funded primary schools and a total of 67,103 students and 4,243 teachers from government-aided primary schools for the year 2020. This brings us to a total of 177,346 students and teachers from government-funded primary schools, and a total of 71,346 students and teachers from government-aided primary schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also find that there are data including the number of primary schools in Singapore - for which there are 139 government-funded primary schools, and 41 government-aided primary schools for the year 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will then take the total average of the average number of students and teachers per government-funded school and the average number of students and teachers per government-aided school.\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage number of students and teachers per government-funded school = 177,346 // 139 = 1275\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage number of students and teachers per government-aided school = 71,346 // 41 = 1740\n\n\nTotal average number of students and teachers per primary school in Singapore = (1275 + 1740) // 2 = 1507\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will multiply then 1507 to the number of schooldays (200) to calculate an approximate annual demand = 1507 * 200 = 301400\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will thus record the demand for primary schools as 301,400.\n\n\nSecondary Schools\n\n\nUsing the data from data.gov.sg, we find that there are a total of 162,071 students and 13,669 teachers from secondary schools across all types for the year 2020. This brings us to a total of 175,740 students and teachers from secondary schools. We also find that there are data including the number of secondaryschools in Singapore - for which there are 136 secondary schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will then take the average number of students and teachers per secondary school.\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage number of students and teachers per secondary school = 175,740 / 136 = 1292\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will multiply then 1292 to the number of schooldays (200) to calculate an approximate annual demand = 1292 * 200 = 258,400\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will thus record the demand for secondary schools as 258,400.\n\n\nKindergartens\n\n\nTo obtain the average number of students in kindergartens, we will use the aggregate data from data.gov.sg using information from MOE kindergartens. \n\n\n\n\n\nUsing data.gov.sg, we find that there are a total of 7517 enrolled students into MOE kindergarten in 2022. We can also observe that there are 43 MOE kindergartens in Singapore as of 2022 from the MOE website from the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will find an average of kindergarten students per kindergarten for our data preparation. \n\n\n\n\n\n7517 // 43 = 174\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will multiply then 174 to the number of schooldays (200) to calculate an approximate annual demand = 174 * 200 = 34,800\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will thus record the demand for kindergartens as  34,800.\n\n\nOther Schools\n\n\nThe Other Schools category consists of the entires People’s Up, Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan, and St Andrew’s Autism School. Since these institutions do not fit any of the three subcategories above, we will assume an average of the subcategories above and use it for this category of school.\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage number of students in Other School = (174 + 1507 + 1292) // 3 = 991.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will multiply then 991 to the number of schooldays (200) to calculate an approximate annual demand = 174 * 200 = 182,200\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will thus record the demand for Other Schools as 182,200.\n\n\nCollege\n\n\nColleges consist of Junior Colleges (JCs). We will define JCs strictly to non-mixed levels schools for simplicity’s sake. We will use data.gov.sg data to obtain the average number of students and teachers in a JC as a basis of demand. From the data.gov.sg data, we can observe that there are 15,373 students, 1,534 teachers, 22 vice principals, 11 principals, and 274 education partners for the year 2020. This brings us up to total of 17,214 people. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe assume that each JC has one principal, which means that for the year 2020, there are 11 JCs. We will then have to find the average number of people in each JC by dividing the number of people over the number of JCs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage number of people in a JC = 17214 // 11 = 1564\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will multiply then 1564 to the number of schooldays (200) to calculate an approximate annual demand = 1564 * 200 = 312,800\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will thus record the demand for Other Schools as 312,800.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPark\n\n\nParks are either manmade or natural environments that houses plants, greenery for human enjoyment and recreation. As mentioned above, East Coast Park is an example. Another example is Katong Park, as seen in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo obtain park visitorship information, we will use our data from East Coast Park as a basis for our demand for the other parks. We will take the total annual visitorship divided by the total area of East Coast Park to obtain an average annual visitor demand to park per unit area. We will then extrapolate each park using the average value.\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal annual visitorship (East Coast Park) = 7,000,000\n\n\nTotal area (East Coast Park) = 1734364.16 square metres\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage annual visitorship (Park) = 7,000,000 // 1734364.16 = 4 visitor per square metre\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of Katong Park, which has an area of 28999.43 square metres, will have an approximate visitorship of 115,997 (28999.43 * 4).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will thus record the demand for parks as 4 visitor per square metre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwimming Pool\n\n\nTo approximate the number of visitors to swimming pools, we will use annual swimming pool attendance obtained from Statista (2.53 million visitors), and divide it by the number of public swimming pools. There are an average of about 3 swimming pools per swimming complex. Since there are 26 public swimming complexes in Singapore, we will multiply 26 with 3 to get 78, the number of public pools in Singapore. We will then divide the number of visitors by 78 to obtain the number of visitors for one public swimming pool.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.53 million / 78 = 32,435 annual visitors per public swimming pool\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will thus record the annual demand for one swimming pool as 32,435 visitors. \n\n\nHospital\n\n\nThere is a single instance of “Hospital” in work area. In the screenshot of our attribute table below, we can see that the single instance is Econ Medicare, a nursing home facility. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Singstat, we can observe that there are currently 16,604 residents in Old Folks’ Home, which is another term for nursing homes. From Data.gov.sg, we can observe that there are 87 Old Folk’s Homes (inclusive of Nursing Homes and Inpatient Palliative Care Homes).\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find the average number of residents in Old Folks’ Home, we will divide he number of residents by the number of homes. \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage number of residents in Old Folks’ Home = 16,604 / 87 = 190\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find the annual visitorship, we assume that each resident has at least one visitor every weeks, conservatively speaking. This means that each year, each resident will be visited at least 52 times. We will then multiply the number of visitation by the average number of residents in Old Folks’ Home. \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage annual visitorship to Old Folks’ Home = 190 * 52= 9880\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will thus record the annual demand for one swimming pool as 9,880 visitors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraveyard\n\n\nTo approximate the annual visitorship to graveyards, we will estimate the number of graves in these graveyards according to their areas. We will do this by obtaining available information on the number of graves per square meter from existing cemeteries - in particular, Choa Chu Kang Cemetary.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will take reference to a Straits Time article, which mentions a scaling-down of the Choa Chu Kang Cemetery from 318 hectares to 200 hectares - with a loss of some 80,500 graves. In this case, we will assume that 118 hectares would be able to contain 80,500 graves, and that subsequently, one hectare would be able to contain 682 graves.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 1 hectare is equivalent to 10,000 square metres, we can safely assume that for every 10,000 square meters, there will be 682 graves.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will also assume, conservatively, that each grave will be visited once per year. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, similar to our Park classification, we will assume that for every 1 square metres, 0.0682 visitors will visit each year. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe will thus record the annual demand for parks as 0.0682 visitors per square metre\n\n\n\n\n\nTheatre\n\n\nWith only one instance of Theatre, which points to the Kallang Theatre, a Performing Arts venue, we will thus assume that large-scale events will be held there at least twice a month. With a size of 1,744 seats, we will round up the visitorship to 1,800 for performers, tech, and administrative personnel. Assuming 1,800 people visit the theatre twice a month, the annual visitorship will be:\n\n\n\n\n\n1800 x 26 = 46800 visitors\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will thus record the annual demand for Theatre as 46,800 visitors\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to insufficient online data or negligible visitorship, we will opt out of any POI from our OSM layer with the following tags:\n\n\n\nPub\n\n\nHotel\n\n\nPitch\n\n\nPlayground\n\n\nCommunity Centre\n\n\nRestaurant\n\n\nFood Court\n\n\nMuseum\n\n\nLibrary\n\n\nFast Food\n\n\nShelter\n\n\nCar Wash\n\n\nArts Centre\n\n\nMall\n\n\nBank\n\n\nPolice\n\n\nConvenience\n\n\nWater Works\n\n\nTrack\n\n\nObservation Tower\n\n\nMonument\n\n\nCastle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary Analysis\n\n\nThese are the following datasets that we have used:\n\n\n\nOpenStreetMaps Layers from GeoFabrik\n\n\nBus stop data from LTA Data Mall\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter downloading the data from relevant websites, we imported the data into QGIS to begin our preliminary analysis. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe did our first preliminary analysis using a 1km buffer zone. For this layer (TELS4_BUFFER_ZONE_SUBZONE), we:\n\n\n\nCreated the following fields:\n\n\n\n\nBUFF_SZ_AREA\n\n\n\n\n$area\n\n\n\n\nSZ_DENSITY \n\n\n\n\n\"SG — 2022_POP_DATA_Total_Population\"   /  \"MP19_SUBZONE_FULL_SZ_AREA\"\n\n\n\n\nBUFF_NAIVE\n\n\n\n\n  \"SZ_DENSITY\"  *  \"BUFF_SZ_AREA\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe organized the data afterwards:\n\n\n\nSaved TELS4_BUFFER_ZONE_SUBZONE as TEL_CIRC_RES_SZ (TEL, circular buffer, residential based on subzone data) with joined layers to do more manipulation\n\n\nClassified segment subzones by population\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsed the Filter option to show a buffer for just a single station, if not the buffers overlap and you can’t see the data underneath\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now see just one MRT catchment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then labelled the MRT stations:\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we create a label for each MRT station. I chose to do it on the TELS4_MRT_STATION_CENTROID layer but could change it to another layer if we wanted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the expression editor and make the value: \"Name\" + ' Station’ so that we see “Station” after each name \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also created a print layout for our preliminary analysis:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe made a default title project style to reduce double work\n\n\n\n\n\nMade a default plan view:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe repeated the print layouts for the remaining train stations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Analysis\n\n\nCreating exit points for each station\n\n\nFor every MRT station, we need to analyse the exact station exits.\n\n\nTo do this, we create a temporary scratch layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the layer name to mrt_name_exits and the geometry type to point.\n\n\nClick OK.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Add Point Feature  add points where the expected exit locations are.\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the layer to a geopackage to make it permenant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreation of Network Analysis layer\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we have the layer, we can create the Iso-Area as Polygon.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the resulting dialogue box, select Run as Batch Process.\n\n\nFill the form with the following attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Run once the form has been filled.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting screen should look something like this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we repeat the steps for the remaining 6 stations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBus Stop Data\n\n\nImporting bus stop data\n\n\nBus stop usage is an on demand data set. We had to do a lot of research on how to access this data as we did not have any prior experience getting GIS data by an API. \n\n\n\n\n\nThankfully, LTA provided data on how to access file using the API. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found that the data must be called with an API request. This was done using two methods:\n\n\nFirstly, using Postman we attempted to download the file:\n\n\n​​\n\n\n\n\n\nThis only allowed us to access data from one month, in an attempt to access the data from earlier months, we decided to access the file programmatically. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis resulted in the exact same file.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs such, we just took the usage data as is.\n\n\n\n\n\nData processing\n\n\nWe needed to code the bus stops to physical locations. This was done with the BusStop layer on data.gov.sg.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth data sets contained the bus stop number field, which we could use as a primary key. The only discrepancy was that the usage data left 4 digit bus stop numbers as 4 digits, while the bus stop location data appended a 0 to the start to make all the numbers 5 digits.\n\n\n\n\n\nType the following code to append a ‘0’ to strings with a 4 digit bus stop. \n\n\n\n\n\nBy checking the file we can see that our code appears to work:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure that all the codes are 5 digits long, we can create an extra formula to check the length of all the adjusted code to ensure that they are indeed 5 digits long.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the new codes are indeed appropriately coded to 5 digits. We can now move on to the next step of amalgamating data at an annual level.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we create a pivot table with the required data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs such, we have the data at daily level. We now need to convert this to an annual level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of days in a year (after considering PHs) is calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy summing the number of days on weekends and PH, we can derive the total number of days for each constant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then multiply the given number by the number of that day type in a year.\n\n\nBy filling down all 15,156 rows, we can see that the formula appears to still apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon further inspection, we can see that there are some bus stops that only run on weekends, the formula failed for these instances. However, since there are not many, we can recode them manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the long and tedious process, we have clean data!\n\n\nWe convert this clean data to a pivot table to aggregate the tap data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can then convert this clean data into a normal table to round the values to an integer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerging bus stop usage data with geospatial data\n\n\nOn the BusStop properties, go to Joins, Add Joins and fill out the details as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis allowed us to successfully code 5045 entries! A 98% success rate, which is more than enough for our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the max value is less than the limitation of int 32, we can use INT32 as our data type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbolisation\n\n\nOnce the data has been converted to an integer, we can apply symbolisation to the points. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Graduated from the drop down menu in the symbolisation pane.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the value, select the newly created, ANNUAL_OUT field.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the Symbol Settings pane.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the  icon to add a new marker.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the newly created lower marker, set the fill colour to Lush Green to match Singapore’s buses. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe use the Digital Colour Meter tool to ensure that the exact same colour is used:\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tool, we can see that the exact desired value is 7CBE31.\n\n\nWe set this value to the fill colour for the Simple Marker earlier mentioned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the above marker, set the layer type to SVG Marker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the SVG Browser section search for Bus.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose the image of the bus in a circle.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the method, choose Size.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bus stops are classified as desired.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick OK to save changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the buses have been successfully classified according to their volume.\n\n\nMerging layers\n\n\nFor aggregate analysis, we should merge all the individual layers into one. \n\n\n\n\n\nGo to Vector > Data Management Tools > Merge Vector Layers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect all the layers that end with _low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave the rest of the parameters as default.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe merged layer is successfully created.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we click the pencil tool and manually delete all of the overlapping iso-areas:\n\n\nAs such, we have an attribute table where each station corresponds with one iso-area shape:\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we use the Field Calculator to add the sum of all tap in data to the table.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur code is as follows:\n\n\naggregate(layer:='BusStop_93655a4c_70b8_4904_8799_bc26487cb098',\n\n\n          aggregate:='sum',\n\n\n          expression:=\"ANNUAL_OUT\",\n\n\n          filter:=contains(geometry(@parent), $geometry)\n\n\n          )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have successfully got the bus tap out data for each station.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now convert this to a bar graph, which we can make in QGIS using the DataPlotly plugin.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resultant bar chart looks as follows. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince it is not ideal to make a bar graph in QGIS, we will instead use Pandas in a Jupyter notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we’re doing so much we might as well analyse all the iso-areas!\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the earlier learnt methods, merge all the layers to a single layer:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new layer is successfully created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a STATION field for organisation.\n\n\nWe then manually go through every shape to find which can be excluded from the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then add the relevant bus tap in and out details to the shapes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now have all the data we need!\n\n\nFor better visualisation, we will use Pandas to analyse the data. As such, we need to export the data to a CSV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis allows us to successfully view all the data in a csv file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can then import this data into a Pandas dataframe:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter renaming the columns, we get the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis allows us to generate the graphs in higher fidelity than what QGIS offers.\n\n\n\n[a]The project report should focus on but not be limited to the followings:\n\n\nA detailed discussion of the GIS analysis process and functions used.\n\n\nA comprehensive discussion of the analysis results.\n\n\nA collection of analytical maps (can be static or interactive web maps)"

    "text": "Test\nA report published by the Singapore Department of Statistics (2020) has shown an increase in ridership, travelling time and distance across all types of public transport in Singapore, possibly leading to increased traffic congestion or breakdowns of public transport systems. Accessible and effective public transportation is essential to enable the thriving economy of the urban-dense, fast-paced island nation. This is why good planning of mass public transport systems like the Mass Rapid Transport (MRT) system is so important. \nMost recently, the development of the Thomson East Coast Line (TEL) has been a crucial part of Singapore’s plan to enable 4 in every 5 households to live within a 10-minute walk of a train station [1]. There have also been plans to expand the islandwide cycling network to about 700km by 2030 [2]. Our team will measure, analyse, and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed Stage 4 TEL stations and the implementation of a cycling path network in those areas. \n\nThe seven Stage 4 TEL stations we will analyse are shown below.\n\n\nIn addition to its much later opening in 2027 [3], most residential areas near the Founders’ Memorial station are covered by buffer zones of the adjacent Tanjong Rhu MRT. We will thus exclude the TE22A Founders’ Memorial MRT station from our analysis.\n\nOur analysis:\n\nInitial Data Exploration and Analysis\n\nUsing OSM data (POIs and residential)\nPopulation data\nBuffer zones\n\nData Extraction\n\nAggregate demand from bus stop data\nOSM Road data\n\nData Classification\n\nManual labelling of OSM road layers for network analysis\n\nCreation of analysis layers\n\nNetwork analysis layer (QNEAT’s Iso Areas) for each MRT station\nMeasuring demand from analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith improved cycling infrastructure such as bike lanes and bike parks, the value and accessibility of the MRT stations are increased significantly. We also note that with the extended reach of cycling expands over multiple MRT lines, which makes it possible for relevant authorities to consider investing in biking infrastructure, rather than MRT stations. \nWe urge the relevant authorities to consider investing higher in biking infrastructure to encourage a transport system that is sustainable, active, and affordable."

    "text": "In resource-scarce Singapore, the primary purpose of public transport is to serve residents with efficient forms of mass transportation. Our study goes beyond traditional catchment analysis methods which focus on pedestrian catchment and also consider cycling catchment. This is in line with the LTA 2040 “Walk, Cycle, Ride” Masterplan and the growing popularity of cycling globally. With an estimated public cost of $25 billion and an ever-increasing ridership, it is essential to critically evaluate the full benefits of stage 4 stations along the Thomson East Coast Line (TEL)."

We created a circular 1 km buffer from each station, to find the number of residents in the buffer area, assuming residents are evenly distributed.\n\n\nNetwork Analysis\nThe next approach is based on the network analysis method. Instead of assuming a naive 1 km buffer, our catchment varies between multiple modes of transport along physical pathways or roads. In this case, the modes of transport include cycling in heavy traffic, cycling without heavy traffic, and walking."
