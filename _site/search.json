    "text": "Circular Buffer Analysis\nAlthough this is a naive method that does not take into account the network lines, we did gain a few insights from the 1 km buffer analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nalt_text\n\n\nAs shown above, the extent of overlap between the buffer zones is different across the TEL Stage 4 MRT stations. This also means that the MRT stations are not equidistant away from each other, with some closer than others. From our analysis, we have observed that the extent of overlap between Marine Parade station and Tanjong Katong station is the largest, followed by the overlap between Marine Parade station and Marine Terrace station.\nHowever, this does not contribute to poor geographical planning as different subzones have different population densities. Based on the map above, the below table comprises the subzones found within the buffer zones, with their respective population density. The list is arranged from highest to lowest population density.\n\n\n\nNo.\nSubzone\nPopulation\nArea\nDensity\n\n\n1\nMarine Parade\n26,880\n1.160 km²\n23,172/km²\n\n\n2\nBedok South\n46,690\n2.997 km²\n15,577/km²\n\n\n3\nKatong\n9,360\n1.079 km²\n8,675/km²\n\n\n4\nFrankel\n34,490\n4.297 km²\n8,026/km²\n\n\n5\nSiglap\n6,440\n1.086 km²\n5,928/km²\n\n\n6\nMountbatten\n9,980\n1.712 km²\n5,830/km²\n\n\n7\nTanjong Rhu\n11,110\n2.051 km²\n5,418/km²\n\n\n8\nBayshore\n7,450\n2.507 km²\n2,972/km²\n\n\n\nFrom the table, Marine Parade subzone is the most densely populated subzone. As such, it is beneficial to have Tanjong Katong and Marine Terrace stations in closer proximity to Marine Parade station to help distribute the demand for TEL stations and reduce human congestion.\nWe also noticed that the Bedok South subzone is the second most densely populated area. As such, it is also practical to have Bayshore station accessible to residents living in the Bedok South subzone, even if Bedok MRT station (found in the East-West Line) is already in place."

We can also see the significant differences in the demand between dedicated cycling routes and cycling on shared roads, from about 3 times to more than 10 times, depending on the station.\nOne thing to note is the concentration of bus trips within the Marine Parade MRT area. This may be due to the overlap of bus stops between the Tanjong Katong and Marine Terrace areas as previously mentioned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalt_text\n\n\nWe can also see the difference between the areas covered by the extended journeys using cycling, which increases significantly - from 10 times to more than 20 times.\nThrough our research and analysis, we have discovered the increased value and accessibility of the Thomson East Coast Line (TEL) by using cycling routes. In line with the goals and provisions by the government for greater access to public transport and active mobility as previously mentioned, the development of biking infrastructure such as dedicated bike lanes and accessible bike parks can enable commuters to safely cycle more in their day-to-day commutes."

    "text": "A report published by the Singapore Department of Statistics (2020) has shown an increase in ridership, travelling time and distance across all types of public transport in Singapore, possibly leading to increased traffic congestion or breakdowns of public transport systems. Accessible and effective public transportation is essential to enable the thriving economy of the urban-dense, fast-paced island nation. This is why good planning of mass public transport systems like the Mass Rapid Transport (MRT) system is so important.\nMost recently, the development of the Thomson East Coast Line (TEL) has been a crucial part of Singapore’s plan to enable 4 in every 5 households to live within a 10-minute walk of a train station 1. There have also been plans to expand the island wide cycling network to about 700 km by 2030 2. Our team will measure, analyse, and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed Stage 4 TEL stations and the implementation of a cycling path network in those areas.\nThe seven Stage 4 TEL stations we will analyse are shown below:\nIn addition to its much later opening in 2027 3, most residential areas near the Founders’ Memorial station are covered by buffer zones of the adjacent Tanjong Rhu MRT. We will thus exclude the TE22A Founders’ Memorial MRT station from our analysis.\nStages of analysis:"

Our study goes beyond traditional catchment analysis methods which focus on pedestrian catchment and also consider cycling catchment. This is in line with the LTA 2040 “Walk, Cycle, Ride” Masterplan and the growing popularity of cycling globally. With an estimated public cost of $25 billion and an ever-increasing ridership, it is essential to critically evaluate the full benefits of stage 4 stations along the Thomson East Coast Line (TEL)."

We created a circular 1 km buffer from each station, to find the number of residents in the buffer area, assuming residents are evenly distributed.\n\n\nNetwork Analysis\nThe next approach is based on the network analysis method. Instead of assuming a naive 1 km buffer, our catchment varies between multiple modes of transport along physical pathways or roads. In this case, the modes of transport include cycling in heavy traffic, cycling without heavy traffic, and walking."
